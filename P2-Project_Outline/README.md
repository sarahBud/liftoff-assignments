### Overview
	I will be creating a dog walking business website. There will be 3 different logins clients, walkers and admins. 
Clients can schedule walks and view/edit their profile. Dog walkers can view their list of scheduled walks for the day and view client profiles. 
Admins can view a list of clients and dog walkers. This website would be useful for any dog walking/pet sitting business. The idea
came from when I was a dog walker in the Washington D.C. area. I worked for a company that used a simliar website but it had a lot of
bugs. I am trying to create a better website that businesses could use.
### Features
User Login: Separate logins for clients, walkers and admins. Each login should show specific information depending on type.
Calendar: Using a calendar for clients to schedule walks, and potentially walkers to view walks day by day.
GPS/Google Maps: Clicking on the client's address on their profile directs to Google Maps (pulling up the address automatically)	
Texting: Walker can click "Start Walk" and "Complete Walk" and client will recieve a text message once these buttons are pushed.
-Stretch Goals-: 
				 Payments: Clients have are able to "Make a Payment"
				 GPS Tracker: Sends a map through texting software outlining the GPS path to client.
### Technologies
C#
Javascript (for calendar/GPS?)
SQL Server
Twilio (for texting)

### What I'll Have to Learn
First of all I'll need to learn how to make user logins, and have them show different information depending on the type of user.
I will need to learn some Javascript for the calendar part most likely. Pulling up a google map, texting and payments are all new
to me and will be a challenge for sure! I will also want to experiment with html/CSS to make the website nice looking, and maybe
use Javascript as well for that.
